## Stack:
#### A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

## Common terminology:
#### Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
#### Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
#### Top - This is the top of the stack.
#### Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
#### IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Some concepts:
### FILO
#### First In Last Out: This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

### LIFO
#### Last In First Out This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Stack Visualization: Hereâ€™s an example of what a stack looks like.


### Push O(1)
#### Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

### Queues:
#### -Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
#### -Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
#### -Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
#### -Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
#### -Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
#### -IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
