## NumPy:
#### is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. 

#### The data is in what I’m going to call ssv (semicolon separated values) format — each record is separated by a semicolon (;), and rows are separated by a new line. There are 1600 rows in the file, including a header row, and 12 columns.

## Creating Array:
- Array creation:
```
import numpy as np
new_array = np.array([1, 1, 1])
array([1, 1, 1])
new_arange = np.arange(10) 
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```



### JupyterLab:
#### Enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manne

### Code Consoles:
> provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output.
### Kernel-backed documents: 
> enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel. 
### Notebook cell: outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.
### Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.
