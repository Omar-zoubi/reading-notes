## Best Whiteboard Interview Advice:
#### Communicate:
- Restate the Question:
 Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. 
- Edge Cases:
Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them.
- Test Cases:
 Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. 
 
 ***Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense***

 ## programming interview:
 1.  Take a few minutes.:
 Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
 2. Write down the steps of the solution:
Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way.
3. Write pseudocode first:
Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.
4. Don’t sweat the small stuff.:
It is all about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.
5. Sit down. Be humble:
It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess.
6. Come prepared:
In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.
7. And finally : Review your work.
