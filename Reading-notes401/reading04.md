## Object:
#### Is an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects. 
### Accessing Object Variables:

### Now we have a copy of `MyClass()` called `myobjectx`.
#### Accessing Object Functions:
![](img/assigne fun.PNG)

#### Now I have an access to all the class including its functions.

## Recursion in Python:
#### A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.
### Recursive Data Structures in Python:
#### Smaller version of itself.


## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage:
### Fixtures:
#### In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition. 
### Coverage:
#### You should do a code coverage, you need it when your code become more complex
