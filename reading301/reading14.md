## Database normalization:
#### A process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included.
### Why Normalization?
#### -Minimize duplicate data.
#### -Minimize or avoid data modification issues.
#### -Simplify queries.

### Type of Normalization:
#### -First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.
#### -Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
#### -Third Normal Form – The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
