## What is JQuery?
#### jQuery is a JS librariy that offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common  JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed.
#### 1. In order to use jQuery, the first  thing you need to do is include  the jQuery script in your page.  You can see that it is included  before the closing body tag.
#### 2. Once jQuery has been added  to the page, a second JavaScript  file is included that uses jQuery  selectors and methods to update the content of the HTML page. 

### JQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript.  It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.


#### LOOPING:
#### In plain JavaScript, if you wanted  to do the same thing to several  elements, you would need to  write code to loop through all of the elements you selected. 
#### CHAINING :
#### If you want to use more than  one jQuery method on the same  selection of elements, you can  list several methods at a time  using dot notation to separate each one, as shown below.

### UPDATING ELEMENTS:
####  .html() 
#### This method gives every element  in the matched set the same new  content. The new content may  include HTML. 
####  .text() 
#### This method gives every element  in the matched set the same new  text content. Any markup would  be shown as text. 
#### .replaceWith() 
#### This method replaces every  element in a matched set with  new content. It also returns the  replaced elements. 
#### .remove()  
#### This method removes all of the elements in the matched set. 
### THE EVENT OBJECT:
#### Every event handling function receives an event object. It has methods and properties related to the event that occurred.

### LOADING JQUERY FROM A CDN:
#### <script src=" //ajax .googl eapi s . com/ ajax/l i bs/ jquery / 1.10. 2/ jquery .min. js ">  </ script> 
#### <script>  window .jQuery 11 document. write (' <script src=" j s/j query- 1.10. 2 .j s 11><\jscri pt> ' )  </script> 
## Pair programing :
### How does pair programming work?
#### Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

### Why pair program?
#### Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.



### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming:
#### 1. Greater efficiency.
#### 2. Engaged collaboration.
#### 3. Learning from fellow students.
#### 4. Social skills.
#### 5. Job interview readiness.
#### 6. Work environment readiness.
