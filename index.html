    <h3>HTML5 Layout</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.</li>
        <li>The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple div elements). </li>
        <li>X Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
        </li>
        <li>To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    <h1>WireFrames</h1>
    <h3><p>A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require</p></h3>
