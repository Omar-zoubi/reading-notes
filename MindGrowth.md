# The Growth Mindset 

 A growth mindset is to believe that fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning . 
Unlike the the fixed mindset ; growth mindset believe the intelligence and talent are just tools; while the fixed mindset believe think that intelligence and talent is the core.

## Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:
1. *Avoid Challenges*
2. *loss focus when obstacles*
3. *when faced effort views as fruitless*
4. *when faced criticism Ignores*
5. *the success of other view as a threat*


## Personal Experiance :
I used to have a fixed mindset and I always thought that the talent and the goodluck is the onley way to success.
Then I start to think in a deferent way and applied some great rules to getover that:
1. *View challenges as opportunities*
2. *Acknowledge and embrace imperfections*
3. *Try different learning tactics*
4. *Follow the research on brain plasticity*
5. *Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”*

After studying some success people life style I didnot found intelligence and talent common factor
its the the ***commitment***
