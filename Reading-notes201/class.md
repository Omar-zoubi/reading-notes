# HTML & CSS

## 

###  USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN
#### If there is no CSS, the rendering engine will apply default styles to HTML elements. However, the HTML code for this example links to a CSS style sheet, so the browser requests that file and displays the page accordingly. When the browser receives CSS rules, the rendering engine processes them and applies each rule to its corresponding elements. This is how the browser positions the elements in the correct place, with the right colors, fonts, and so on. 

*CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look*
*Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements*
*Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.*
*CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.*
