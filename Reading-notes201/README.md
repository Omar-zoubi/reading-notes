# HTML

## How People Access the Web ?
- Browsers : People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

- Web Servers : When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website .

- Screen readers Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.

# HTML Markup :
#### HTML has many version, DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
#### The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

#### The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

# HTML Layout: 
#### The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
#### Older browsers that do not understand HTML5elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
#### To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# Process & Design:
 ### It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
 ###  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
 ### Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
