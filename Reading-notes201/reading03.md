# HTML 
## Lists:
### There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
1. #### Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
2. #### Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
3. #### Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

* ***Ordered lists use numbers.***
* ***Unordered lists use bullets.***
* ***Definition lists are used to define terminology.***
* ***Lists can be nested inside one another***

## Box Dimintion 
* #### By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
* #### Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide

## Border :
#### Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

## Margin :
#### Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
## Padding :
#### Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

* #### Hidding box:
#### It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.

 # ARRAYS:
 * ### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
 * ### Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
